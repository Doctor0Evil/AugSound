AugSound is an augmented-user interaction-platform designed for smart-city infrastructure, planning, and technology that is related-to smart-city development, structures, and designs ( such as xr smart-glass, eco-walkways, and indoor-gyms ) that is an "easy-way" to focus on constructive, motivational, and fitness sounds for mood, training, shopping, and travel, and is intentionally designed-to put, and keep augmented-citizens in a better-mood, and motivate them when shopping,, traveling, and working-out. 

AugSound is built-for the average, every-day worker, individual, musician, artist, and more ( every day you! ); the development-stages for AugSound are to-be programmed for easy-application, and intwegration of smart-city technologies that are new, and emerging, reducing the cost, and almost-entirely eliminating the need for complicated speaker-setups,  complex building floor-plans that involve electrical-wiring, and production-rig architectures that mean massive-workloads, extensive/oversized crews for construction, etc. by including the programming within the technology, so that the infrastructure-developments are easy, and require less manual-labor for installation, or construction in major designs like shopping-centers, gymnasiums, elevators/escalators, and service-buildings, or motor-vehicles like tesla, and other major companies.
